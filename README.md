# 🎯 Built a YouTube Clone from Scratch — Real-Time Chat, Live Search, Caching & More! 🚀 

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working hard on building a full-fledged **YouTube Clone** — from scratch!

---

## 🔵 Key Features I Implemented:
- ✅ **Live YouTube Search** with real-time autocomplete functionality.
- ✅ **YouTube API integration** to fetch live video feeds.
- ✅ **Debouncing in Search** to optimize API calls and reduce server load.
- ✅ **Infinite Scroll** for seamless browsing without manual pagination.
- ✅ **Shimmer UI Effect** for smooth, polished loading states.
- ✅ **Live Chat System** with anonymous chatting like on YouTube Live streams.
- ✅ **nth-Level Nested Comments** feature to enable deep threaded discussions.
- ✅ **Optimized Data Handling** with Redux Toolkit for state management.
- ✅ **API Caching** to improve performance and reduce redundant network requests.

## 💡 Let's Dive Deeper into Some Concepts:

### 🔹 Debouncing in Search
Instead of firing an API request on every keystroke, I implemented **debouncing** — a technique that waits for the user to stop typing before sending the request.

**Result:**
- ✔️ Fewer API calls
- ✔️ Better performance
- ✔️ Smoother user experience

### 🔹 Caching API Responses
I built a simple **caching mechanism** that stores previous search results. If a user searches for the same keyword again, the app pulls from the cache instead of making another API call.

**Result:**
- ✔️ Faster responses
- ✔️ Lower API usage
- ✔️ Improved efficiency

### 🔹 Building Nested Comments
I designed a **recursive component** to handle nth-level nested comments, allowing users to have dynamic discussions — just like the comment threads you see under YouTube videos!

**Result:**
- ✔️ Elegant structure
- ✔️ Infinite reply chains supported

### 🔹 Live Chat Feature
Building the **Live Chat** was particularly challenging and fun! Messages update in **real-time** without a page refresh, giving users the feel of an active, buzzing conversation.

**Features:**
- ✔️ Anonymous users supported
- ✔️ Smooth and interactive UI
- ✔️ Real-time updates using component state management

## 🌟 Biggest Learnings from This Project:
- 📌 API handling best practices
- 📌 State management with Redux Toolkit
- 📌 Performance optimization through caching and debouncing
- 📌 Recursive rendering of UI components
- 📌 User experience (UX) improvements with Shimmer effects and Infinite scrolling
- 📌 Handling real-time data updates efficiently

## 🔍 Looking Ahead
This project wasn’t just about building a YouTube clone — it was about **leveling up my skills** in:
- Frontend architecture
- Real-time systems
- Building user-centric interfaces

git clone https://github.com/mutayyab01/youtube.git
```
## 2. 📂 Navigate into the Project Directory
```bash
cd youtube
```
## 3. 🛠️ Install Project Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## 4. ⚙️ Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
VITE_NINJA_API_KEY=your_Ninja_api_key_here
VITE_CORS_API_KEY=your_CORS_api_key_here
```
## 5. ▶️ Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
